Intelligent Renewable Energy Management System
This project develops an intelligent renewable energy management system that integrates solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage, and grid connectivity within a unified IIoT architecture. Using five ESP32 microcontrollers connected via the PainlessMesh protocol and a Raspberry Pi as the central server, the system enables real-time data acquisition and device coordination. A SCADA-based interface provides supervision, monitoring, and control of all hybrid energy components, while cloud connectivity and advanced analytics support predictive maintenance, performance optimization, and digital-twin modeling. The goal of this project is to maximize energy production, improve system reliability, and reduce operational costs through intelligent, data-driven decision-making.
“The following three AI models process the data collected by the system and generate outputs used to manage and optimize the operation of the project.”
